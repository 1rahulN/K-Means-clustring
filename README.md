# K-Means-clustring
K-means clustering, originating from signal processing, is a technique in vector quantization. Its objective is to divide a set of n observations into k clusters, with each observation assigned to the cluster whose mean (cluster center or centroid) is closest, thereby acting as a representative of that cluster.
